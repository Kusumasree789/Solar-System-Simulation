# Solar System Simulation

An interactive and visually appealing simulation of our Solar System. Watch as the planets orbit around the Sun with adjustable speeds for each planet's orbit. This project provides an engaging way to explore the mechanics of the solar system, with dynamic animations and real-time control.

## Features

- **Interactive Solar System**: Watch the planets orbit around the Sun in real-time.
- **Customizable Speeds**: Adjust the speed of the entire solar system, or each planet's orbit individually.
- **Realistic Planet Representation**: Each planet is accurately represented with different sizes, and their orbits are visually animated for a realistic experience.
- **Smooth Animation**: Enjoy smooth transitions and accurate orbit simulations powered by JavaScript and CSS animations.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the webpage, including the solar system and control elements.
- **CSS**: Applied to style the solar system and animate the planets and orbits.
- **JavaScript**: Controls the interactive elements such as adjusting orbit speeds, and manages the dynamic behavior of the simulation.

# Usage
Once the simulation is running in your browser, interact with the solar system by adjusting the speed of the orbits using the provided controls. You can increase or decrease the speed of the entire system, or tweak the speed of each planet's orbit individually for a more detailed view.
